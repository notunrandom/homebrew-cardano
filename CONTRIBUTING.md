# Contributing

[Homebrew][brew] is a package manager for MacOS and Linux. It can greatly
improve the user experience of installing tools or libraries on those
platforms.

"Mainstream" packages can be added to the official Homebrew list of packages
(by submitting pull requests on the [Homebrew/Core][core] repository).

Packages that do not fit the requirements of Homebrew-core can be provided by
creating a ["tap"][taps], i.e. an additional and unofficial "Third-party"
source of Homebrew packages.

The Haskell cardano-node itself, and consequently many tools that use the same
dependencies, are not currently ["acceptable formulae"][acceptable] for
[Homebrew/Core][core] so for the time being, I have created a Third-party tap:

<https://github.com/notunrandom/homebrew-cardano>

N.B. The repository must have the `homebrew-` prefix in its name. But in `brew`
commands, one usually refers to this tap without the `homebrew-` prefix.

## Adding formulae

To add a formula, start by adding the tap to your local Homebrew installation
(**N.B.** this clones the repository using the HTTP URL, see below for the
alternative):

```bash
brew tap notunrandom/cardano
```

This actually clones the [notunrandom/homebrew-cardano][tap] repository into
your local Homebrew installation. The path to the local git repository will be
provided in the output of the previous commande, e.g.:

```bash
==> Tapping notunrandom/cardano
Cloning into '/opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/notunrandom/homebrew-cardano'...

remote: Counting objects: 100% (57/57), done.

Receiving objects: 100% (57/57), 17.00 KiB | 8.50 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (15/15), done.
Tapped 4 formulae (20 files, 48.1KB).
```

It is also possible to specify the URL of the tap, which is useful for example
if one wishes to make changes to the repository using SSH and a key-pair rather
than HTTP authentication:

```bash
brew tap notunrandom/cardano git@github.com:notunrandom/homebrew-cardano.git
```

Now you can `cd` to the directory and use Git as usual. It is also possible to
use `brew` to find the correct directory:

```
cd $(brew --repo notunrandom/cardano)
```

But `brew` also provides facilities, for example to create an initial version
of your new formula.

Identify the URL of the repository for which you want to create a formula.
The URL must point to a .tar.gz (not a .zip) of the source code of a specific
branch, tag or commit. Look at the `url` field in existing formulae or follow
these examples:

- <https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/archive/refs/tags/10.5.1.tar.gz>
  points to a version tag.
- <https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/archive/refs/heads/release/ouroboros-consensus-0.28.0.0.tar.gz>
  points to a release/version branch
- <https://github.com/intersectMBO/libsodium/archive/dbb48cce5429cb6585c9034f002568964f1ce567.tar.gz>
  points to a commit - here brew will not be able to deduce a version so a
  `--set-version` flag will be needed.

Use `brew create --help` to see whether brew has a template for the kind of
code used in the repository (e.g. it has a `--cabal` option for Haskell and a
`--rust` option for Rust).

Use `brew create` to initialise your formula, specifying the tap, the template
and the URL.

Here is a first example, for Moog, which is a Haskell project built with Cabal,
and has version tags:

```bash
brew create --tap notunrandom/cardano --cabal https://github.com/cardano-foundation/moog/archive/refs/tags/v0.4.1.1.tar.gz
```

Here is a second example, for Amaru, which is a Rust project which does not yet
have version tags or branches, so we will use the HEAD of main and manually
specify a low version:

```bash
brew create --tap notunrandom/cardano --rust --set-version 0.1.0.0 https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
```

This will open an editor session of the generated Formula. You can keep the
session open to continue editing the Formula, or close it and open the file
later or with another editor.

Make sure you are working in a branch, and one formula at a time. So, before
continuing work on the `amaru` formula:

```
pushd $(brew --repo notunrandom/cardano)
git checkout -b amaru
```

From now on, as you work on the formula, you can commit (locally) to save your
progress.

To adapt the generated formula to the specifics of the project, get inspiration
from existing formula in the [notunrandom/cardano][tap], read the [Formula
Cookbook][formula] and/or get inspiration from exiting formulae in
[Homebrew/Core][core].

When you are ready to try it out, you must first test your formula locally
using these three steps (I will use the example of the Amaru formula
initialised above):

```
HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1 brew audit --new amaru
```

This will analyse your formula code, it's like a linter. Fix all errors before proceeding.

```
HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1 brew install --build-from-source --verbose --debug amaru
```

This will attempt to use your Formula to build, from source, a locally
installed version of the package. Again, fix all errors before proceeding. N.B.
Once the installation succeeded at least once, if you want to make changes, you
will need to replace `install` by `reinstall` in the above command.

```
HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1 brew test amaru
```

This will test the resulting installation (using the test you should have
provided in the formula).

Once you are satisfied that your formula is working, you can commit your new
formula.

Important:

- you must work in a branch, and one formula at a time.
- you must push your branch to the upstream repo so that a pull request can be
  created. Do not push directly to main.
- you must use a pull request to submit your new or modified formula (only this
  way will the GitHub actions be usable)
- your pull request must only concern a single formula - use a separate branch
  and separate pull request for each formula you add or modify.

For the maintainers of the tap, the last stages are done in GitHub:

1. Create a pull request from the pushed branch.
2. Wait for the GitHub actions triggered by the pull request to complete.
3. If they are all green, add the "pr-pull" label to the PR - this will
   automatically merge and delete the branch, create the "bottles" and put them
   in "Releases", add the links to the "bottles" in the formula and close the
   PR.

## Creating a tap

Although new Formulae can now be added to the existing
[notunrandom/cardano tap][tap], the process of creating the tap is documented
here for posterity or future reference.

Create a completely empty GitHub repository for formulae, whose name must be
prefixed with "homebrew": e.g. notunrandom/homebrew-cardano

Then locally create a new tap, initialise git and push:

```
brew tap-new --no-git notunrandom/homebrew-cardano
pushd $(brew --repo notunrandom/cardano)
git init -b main
git config user.name "notunrandom"
git config user.email "122674938+notunrandom@users.noreply.github.com"
git add .github README.md
git commit -m"Genesis"
git remote add origin git@github.com:notunrandom/homebrew-cardano.git
git push -u origin main
```

Then from GitHub, add a license, then locally, pull, and create a branch:

```
git pull
```

This (with the `--no-git` option) is the most failsafe process, so that you can
control the git init process.
